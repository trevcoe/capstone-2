I will use react and node for this project.

I would like to focus more on the front end, I feel like Iâ€™m better at front end work.

I would like it to be a website.

My project will be a website that allows users to search for different crypto currencies, and displays the currency, value, and what the coin is intended to do. 

My demographic is probably 16+, I don't think young children are interested in crypto. I could be wrong, though.
