I will use react and node for this project.

I would like to focus more on the front end, I feel like Iâ€™m better at front end work.

I would like it to be a website.

My project will be a website that allows users to search for different crypto currencies, and displays the currency, value, and what the coin is intended to do. 

My demographic is probably 16+, I don't think young children are interested in crypto. I could be wrong, though. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/ This api has a lot of the infromation I'd like to use. 

I dont think there's any sensitive information, as its just an encylopedia style website. I could add user accounts and have followed coins, or favorite coins.

Website log in -> search bar -> coin price/definition

A stretch goal could be, allowing users to guess what a coins value will be in a week, and then a week later the website compares the guess with the actual value 
and reports the difference back to the user.
